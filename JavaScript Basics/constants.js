// Variables are able to be re-declared as new values as they vary (hence variables)
// Constants are used when we have a never changing value that will not be reassigned

// Because we used const for interestRate it's value is always 0.3 and will never be able to be changed
const interestRate = 0.3;
console.log(interestRate);
